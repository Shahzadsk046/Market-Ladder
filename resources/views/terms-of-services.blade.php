                            <p>Theoretical buy and sell methods were tested against the past to prove the profitability of
                                those methods, as they would have worked in the past. Backtesting theories to gain
                                confidence may or may not provide accurate forecasts. The information from this Site is
                                typically the result of backtesting, and is therefore merely hypothetical. Performance
                                generated through backtesting has many and possibly serious limitations.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Additionally, Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. There may be
                                substantial, even extreme, differences between historical performance and future
                                performance. The Market Ladder does not claim or warrant that its trade ideas/ setups,
                                forecasts, opinions, analyses, are consistent, logical or free from hindsight or other bias.

                            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the The Market Ladder and our affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party. The Market Ladder reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with the The Market Ladder’s defense of such claim.</p>

                            <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site, or to any products or services sold or distributed by The Market Ladder or through the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. <br>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Legalinc Corporate Services Inc., [7319 Mint Hill Rd, Suite 1, #2764 Mint Hill, NC 28227]. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, the Company will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
